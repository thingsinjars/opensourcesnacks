Seed snacks are the perfect web dev snack: they're tasty, they're low-fat, they're vegan-friendly, they're gluten-free. I've always got a tub of some next to my monitor so, when I'm chewing over a tricky layout, I can grab a handful and chew them, too.

This project aims to collect great and easy-to-make seed recipes and share/improve them via the code collaboration site [GitHub](https://github.com/).
