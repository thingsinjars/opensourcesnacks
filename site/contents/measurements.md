Measurements
---

The measurements used here are relative and volume-based. This means that if it says 1 cup, it doesn't matter if you use one big mug or one small doll's teacup, as long as you use the same everywhere. Of course, that doesn't work with the teaspoon and tablespoon measurements. Justâ€¦ experiment.
