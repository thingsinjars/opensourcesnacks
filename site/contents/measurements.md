Measurements

The measurements used here are relative and volume-based. This means that if it says 1 cup, it doesn't matter if you use one big mug or one small doll's teacup, as long as you use the same everywhere.

It's a bit tricky to convert these recipes to metric as '1 cup of sunflower seeds' doesn't weigh the same as '1 cup of sesame seeds'. Odd but true.
